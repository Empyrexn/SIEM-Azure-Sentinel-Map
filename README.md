What I learned in this Homelab:

1. Cloud Infrastructure and Virtualization
Azure Environment Setup: Learned how to navigate the Azure portal and set up essential cloud infrastructure components, including virtual machines and networking.
Virtual Machine Configuration: Gained hands-on experience in configuring and managing virtual machines within Azure, focusing on Windows VMs. This includes understanding VM size specifications, security types, and geographic considerations for deployment.
2. Network Security and Monitoring
Network Security Groups (NSG): Configured NSGs to manage inbound and outbound network traffic rules for virtual machines, crucial for protecting cloud environments.
Honeypot Deployment: By setting up a honeypot, I explored a proactive security mechanism designed to attract and analyze attacks which enhanced my understanding of threat dynamics and attacker behaviors.
3. Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)
Azure Sentinel Setup: Set up and configured Azure Sentinel, Microsoft's SIEM system, gaining insights into how SIEM systems collect, analyze, and respond to security data.
Log Management: Learned about the integration of log data into Azure Sentinel, including setting up Log Analytics workspaces to aggregate and analyze security data from various sources.
4. Windows Security and Event Management
Event Log Management: Configured the collection of Windows security event logs.
Microsoft Defender for Cloud: Configured this service to enhance the security posture of your cloud environment, learning about its capabilities in managing security across cloud and hybrid environments.
5. Scripting and Automation
PowerShell Scripting: Utilized PowerShell for automation tasks, specifically to extract and manipulate security log data. This improved my understanding of how automation can enhance security operations.
6. Geolocation and Data Visualization
IP Geolocation Integration: By integrating with a third-party IP geolocation API,  learned how to enrich log data with geographic information, which is essential for understanding the origins of network threats.
Data Visualization in SIEM: Created and customized visual representations of security data in Azure Sentinel using Kusto Query Language (KQL), particularly focusing on displaying attack data on a world map.
